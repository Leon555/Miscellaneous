<p>One of the main places you find XPath is XSLT. Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformations (XSLT) is powerful way to transform files from one format to another. Originally it could only operate on XML files, although the output could be any form of text file. Since version 2.0 however, it also has the capability to use any text file as an input. XSLT is a declarative language and uses templates to define the output that should result from processing different parts of the source files.<br />
XSLT is often used to transform XML to (X)HTML, either server-side or in the browser. The<br />
advantages of doing a client-side transformation are that it offloads the presentational side of the process to the application layer that deals with the display. Additionally it frees resources on the server making it more responsive, and it tends to reduce the amount of data transmitted between the server and the browser. This is especially the case when the data consists of many rows of similar data that are to be shown in tabular form. HTML tables are very verbose and can easily double or triple the amount of bandwidth between client and server.</p>
