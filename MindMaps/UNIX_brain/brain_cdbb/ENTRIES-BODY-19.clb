<p>For each option, we have three possibilities for a platform’s support status.</p>
<p>1. If the symbolic constant is either undefined or defined to have the value −1, then the corresponding option is unsupported by the platform at compile time. It is possible to run an old application on a newer system where the option is supported, so a runtime check might indicate the option is supported even though the option wasn’t supported at the time the application was compiled.</p>
<p>2. If the symbolic constant is defined to be greater than zero, then the corresponding option is supported.</p>
<p>3. If the symbolic constant is defined to be equal to zero, then we must call sysconf, pathconf, or fpathconf to determine whether the option is supported.</p>
