  Name   [  edit  ]   
 Originally, the name "POSIX" referred to IEEE Std 1003.1-1988, released in 1988. The family of POSIX standards is formally designated as  IEEE 1003  and the international standard name is  ISO / IEC  9945. 
 The standards emerged from a project that began circa 1985.  Richard Stallman  suggested the name  POSIX  to the IEEE instead of former  IEEE-IX . The committee found it more easily pronounceable and memorable, so the committee adopted it.   [ 2 ]      [ 4 ]    [   better-source-needed   ]  
  Overview   [  edit  ]   
 The POSIX specifications for  Unix -like  operating system  environments originally consisted of a single document for the core programming interface, but eventually grew to 19 separate documents (for example, POSIX.1, POSIX.2 etc.)  [1] . The standardized user  command line  and  scripting interface  were based on the  Korn shell  [   citation needed   ] . Many user-level programs, services, and utilities including  awk ,  echo ,  ed  were also standardized, along with required program-level services including basic  I/O  ( file ,  terminal , and  network ) services. POSIX also defines a standard  threading  library API which is supported by most modern operating systems. Nowadays, most of POSIX parts are combined into a single standard,  IEEE Std 1003.1-2008 , also known as  POSIX.1-2008 . 
 As of 2009  [update]  , POSIX documentation is divided in two parts: 
 
 POSIX.1-2008: POSIX Base Definitions, System Interfaces, and Commands and Utilities (which include POSIX.1, extensions for POSIX.1, Real-time Services, Threads Interface, Real-time Extensions, Security Interface, Network File Access and Network Process-to-Process Communications, User Portability Extensions, Corrections and Extensions, Protection and Control Utilities and Batch System Utilities) 
 POSIX Conformance Testing: A test suite for POSIX accompanies the standard:  PCTS  or the  POSIX Conformance Test Suite .   [ 5 ]    
 
 The development of the POSIX standard takes place in the  Austin Group , a joint  working group  linking the Open Group and the ISO organization. 
  Versions   [  edit  ]

  Versions after 1997   [  edit  ]   
 After 1997, the  Austin Group  developed the POSIX revisions. The specifications are known under the name  Single UNIX Specification , before they become a POSIX standard when formally approved by the ISO. 
  POSIX.1-2001   [  edit  ]   
  POSIX.1-2001  or IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 equates to the  Single UNIX Specification version 3    [ 6 ]    
 This standard consisted of: 
 
 the Base Definitions, Issue 6, 
 the System Interfaces and Headers, Issue 6, 
 the Commands and Utilities, Issue 6. 
 
  POSIX.1-2001 (with two TCs)   [  edit  ]   
 IEEE Std 1003.1-2004 involved a minor update of POSIX.1-2001. It incorporated two technical  corrigenda .   [ 7 ]    Its contents are available on the web.   [ 8 ]    
  POSIX.1-2008   [  edit  ]   
 As of 2009  [update]    POSIX.1-2008  or IEEE Std 1003.1-2008 represents the current version.   [ 9 ]      [ 10 ]    A free online copy is available.   [ 11 ]    
 This standard consists of: 
 
 the Base Definitions, Issue 7, 
 the System Interfaces and Headers, Issue 7, 
 the Commands and Utilities, Issue 7. 
 
  Controversies   [  edit  ]   
  512- vs 1024-byte blocks   [  edit  ]   
 POSIX mandates 512-byte block sizes for the  df  and  du  utilities, reflecting the default size of blocks on disks. When  Richard Stallman  and the  GNU  team were implementing POSIX for the  GNU operating system , they objected to this on the grounds that most people think in terms of 1024 byte (or 1  KiB ) blocks. The environment variable  POSIXLY_CORRECT  was introduced to allow the user to force the standards-compliant behaviour.   [ 12 ]    The variable name  POSIX_ME_HARDER  was also discussed.   [ 13 ]    
  POSIX-oriented operating systems   [  edit  ]   
 Depending upon the degree of compliance with the standards, one can classify operating systems as fully or partly POSIX compatible. Certified products can be found at the IEEE's website.   [ 14 ]    
  Fully POSIX-compliant   [  edit  ]   
 Some versions of the following operating systems conform (i.e., are 100% compliant) to one or more of the various POSIX standards.

  POSIX for Windows   [  edit  ]   
 
  Cygwin  provides a largely POSIX-compliant development and run-time environment for  Microsoft Windows .
 
  MinGW , formerly a  fork  of Cygwin, provides a less POSIX-compliant development environment and supports compatible  C -programmed applications via  Msvcrt , Microsoft's old Visual C runtime library. 
 
 
  Microsoft POSIX subsystem , an optional Windows subsystem included in Windows NT-based operating systems up to Windows 2000. POSIX-1 as it stood in 1990 revision — no threads, no sockets. 
  Interix , originally OpenNT by Softway Systems, Inc., is an upgrade and replacement for  Microsoft POSIX subsystem  that was purchased by  Microsoft  in 1999. It was initially marketed as a stand-alone add-on product and then later included it as a component in  Windows Services for UNIX  (SFU) and finally incorporated it as a component in  Windows Server 2003 R2  and later Windows OS releases under the name "Subsystem for UNIX-based Applications" (SUA); later made deprecated in 2012 (Windows 8)   [ 23 ]    and dropped in 2013 (2012 R2, 8.1). It enables full POSIX compliance for certain  Microsoft Windows  products [   citation needed   ] . 
  UWIN  from AT&T Research implements a POSIX layer on top of the Win32 APIs. 
  MKS Toolkit , originally created for MS-DOS, is a software package produced and maintained by  MKS Inc.  that provides a  Unix-like  environment for scripting, connectivity and porting  Unix  and  Linux  software to both 32- and 64-bit  Microsoft Windows  systems. A subset of it was included in the first release of  Windows Services for UNIX  (SFU) in 1998.   [ 24 ]    
 
  POSIX for OS/2   [  edit  ]   
 Mostly POSIX compliant environments for  OS/2 : 
 
  emx+gcc  – largely POSIX compliant 
 
  POSIX for DOS   [  edit  ]   
 Partially POSIX compliant environments for  DOS  include: 
 
  emx+gcc  – largely POSIX compliant 
  DJGPP  – partially POSIX compliant 
 
  Compliant via compatibility feature   [  edit  ]   
 The following are not officially certified as POSIX compatible, but they conform in large part to the standards by implementing POSIX support via some sort of compatibility feature, usually translation libraries, or a layer atop the kernel. Without these features, they are usually noncompliant. 
 
  eCos -– POSIX is part of standard distribution, and used by many applications. 'external links' section below has more information. 
  MorphOS  (through the built-in ixemul library) 
  OpenVMS  (through optional POSIX package) 
  OpenVOS  is an optional POSIX-compliant layer atop the  Stratus VOS  kernel   [ 25 ]    
  Plan 9 from Bell Labs  APE - ANSI/POSIX Environment   [ 26 ]    
  Symbian OS  with  PIPS  (PIPS Is POSIX on Symbian) 
  Windows NT kernel  when using Microsoft  SFU  3.5 or SUA
 
  Windows 2000 Server or Professional with Service Pack 3 or later . To be POSIX compliant, one must activate optional features of Windows NT and Windows 2000 Server.   [ 27 ]    
  Windows XP Professional with Service Pack 1 or later  
  Windows Server 2003  
  Windows Vista  (Ultimate / Enterprise) 
  Windows 7  (Ultimate / Enterprise) 
 
 
  z/OS  (is certified as compliant)
