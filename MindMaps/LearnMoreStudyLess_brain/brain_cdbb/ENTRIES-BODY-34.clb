<p><span style=" font-family: Sylfaen;"><span style=" font-size: small;">than just reading fast, as sometimes you will want to slow down to carefully examine one section, and skim over another that is less important.</span></span><span style=" font-size: small;"></span></p>
<p><span style=" font-family: Sylfaen;"><span style=" font-size: small;">To start using a pointer, grab a book and place your index finger right below the line you want to read.
