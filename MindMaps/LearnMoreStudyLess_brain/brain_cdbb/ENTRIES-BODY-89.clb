<p><span style=" font-family: Sylfaen;"><span style=" font-size: small;"><b>1) Do you exercise 3-5 times per week?</b> If the answer is no, you’re undercutting your potential energy levels. Unless you’re unable to exercise for medical reasons, there is no excuse for not getting your 40 minutes a day. A small investment in exercise can have a huge impact on your ability to concentrate and work quickly.</span></span><span style=" font-size: small;"></span></p>
<p><span style=" font-family: Sylfaen;"><span style=" font-size: small;"><b>2) Do you get 7-8 hours of sleep each night? </b>Some people work best on 4-5 hours of sleep. But I’m willing to bet neither of us can do that. Pulling an all-nighter is a dangerous move when you need to keep your mind sharp.</span></span><span style=" font-size: small;"></span></p>
<p><span style=" font-family: Sylfaen;"><span style=" font-size: small;"><b>3) What do you eat?</b> Do you eat a diet high in meat, fat and sugar? Switch to a diet that emphasizes whole grains and unprocessed foods. This will keep your blood sugar levels even throughout the day, avoiding the highs and lows.</span></span><span style=" font-size: small;"></span></p>
<p><span style=" font-family: Sylfaen;"><span style=" font-size: small;"><b>4) How many glasses of water do you drink each day?</b> You are over two-thirds water. Dehydrating yourself is a quick way to zap your energy.</span></span></p>

<div class="column"><span style=" font-family: Sylfaen;"><span style=" font-size: small;"><b>5) What meals do you eat each day</b>? If your answer is lunch, dinner and sometimes breakfast, you’re energy levels will suffer. Ideally, you should eat 4-5 smaller meals throughout the day to ensure a more constant supply of nutrients. Eating a bit right before bed can also help with morning grogginess by avoiding low-blood sugar when you wake up.</span></span><span style=" font-size: small;"></span></div>
