<p><span style=" font-family: Sylfaen;"><span style=" font-size: small;">1) Give yourself several blank sheets of white paper. Take all the notes for the particular course or sub-unit you want to compress. This exercise can take an hour or two, so make sure you have the time.</span></span><span style=" font-size: small;"></span></p>
<p><span style=" font-family: Sylfaen;"><span style=" font-size: small;">2) Starting with the smallest writing you can use, write down a major idea from your notes. Use as few words as possible.</span></span><span style=" font-size: small;"></span></p>
<p><span style=" font-family: Sylfaen;"><span style=" font-size: small;">3) Next to that idea, write a related idea, formula, concept or definition. Write the idea in small lettering and use few words as a description to save space.</span></span><span style=" font-size: small;"></span></p>
<p><span style=" font-family: Sylfaen;"><span style=" font-size: small;">4) Continue this process of writing ideas in a loose format, until you have written down, in reduced form, every major idea from your notes. You should end up with a 1-3 sheets of paper with densely written information.</span></span><span style=" font-size: small;"></span></p>
<p><span style=" font-family: Sylfaen;"><span style=" font-size: small;">5) As an additional step, you may want to rewrite this page for better organization if your first attempt is difficult to sort through, or connections between the material are hard to see.</span></span><span style=" font-size: small;"></span></p>
