<p><span style=" font-family: Sylfaen;"><span style=" font-size: small;">1) Keep it Small. A project should push your abilities forward, but massive, year- long adventures can start to drag after several months. If learning is your goal, keep the projects within a few months.</span></span><span style=" font-size: small;"></span></p>
<p><span style=" font-family: Sylfaen;"><span style=" font-size: small;">2) Write it Down. Commit to your project on paper, otherwise it won’t last. I don’t recommend committing to projects if you seriously doubt your motivation is strong enough to last. However, written documents can help you stay focused if you feel frustrated or bored by the next immediate activity.</span></span><span style=" font-size: small;"></span></p>
<p><span style=" font-family: Sylfaen;"><span style=" font-size: small;">3) Create an Objective Outcome. Just working on a project isn’t always enough. I’ve found my learning efforts work best if there is a clear goal at the end of the project. If the project serves a function beyond just learning, you can boost your motivation towards continuing it.</span></span><span style=" font-size: small;"></span></p>
