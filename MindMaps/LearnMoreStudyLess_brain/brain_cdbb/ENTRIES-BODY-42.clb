<p><span style=" font-family: Sylfaen;"><span style=" font-size: small;">Metaphors are a literary tool that describe an object by relating it to something that it isn’t actually associated with. Saying a woman has an hourglass figure, doesn’t mean that she is made of glass and sand falls from the top of her body to a lower half. Instead, it is a metaphor comparing the curves of her figure to the curves of an hourglass.</span></span><span style=" font-size: small;"></span></p>

<p><span style=" font-family: Sylfaen;"><span style=" font-size: small;">1) Identify the information you want to better understand or remember. In our case it was classical conditioning.</span></span><span style=" font-size: small;"></span></p>
<p><span style=" font-family: Sylfaen;"><span style=" font-size: small;">2) Find something in your experience that matches part of the idea you want to understand. Perfect matches are often impossible, so compromise with a couple imperfect metaphors instead of a complete match. In our case we used walking through snow as an example.</span></span><span style=" font-size: small;"></span></p>
<p><span style=" font-family: Sylfaen;"><span style=" font-size: small;">3) Repeat this process and check for circumstances where the metaphor doesn’t apply. With this example, walking through snow is a linear process, whereas brain neural connections have many different impulses running at the same time.</span></span><span style=" font-size: small;"></span></p>
