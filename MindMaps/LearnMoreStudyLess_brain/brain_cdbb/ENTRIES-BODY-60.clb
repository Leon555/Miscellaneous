<p><span style=" font-family: Sylfaen;"><span style=" font-size: small;">This step is the basis of the link method. What you want to do is create vivid and exaggerated mental images that associate two symbols in the sequence. This means you will need to create a mental image linking 1 and 2, 2 and 3, 3 and 4, etc.</span></span><span style=" font-size: small;"></span></p>
<p><span style=" font-family: Sylfaen;"><span style=" font-size: small;">With our grocery list we would have to first create a mental image that links bananas to milk. For this I might imagine a giant banana that has cow spots on it. I could also imagine a farmer milking a banana’s udders instead of a cow. These ridiculous mental images are important for creating the link. If the link isn’t wildly exaggerated and vivid, it will be difficult to recall. Simply picturing an ordinary jug of milk next to a banana wouldn’t be sufficient to create a strong link. But a cow-spotted banana or a banana being milked are both crazy enough to stick in memory.</span></span><span style=" font-size: small;"></span></p>
<p><span style=" font-family: Sylfaen;"><span style=" font-size: small;">After you create link between two items, make a link between the next two items. So for our grocery list that means you would need a link between milk and baked beans. Again, a cow-spotted bean or a giant bean wrestling a carton of milk might be vivid enough to create a link.<br />
Try continuing with our grocery list to create your own links between beans and </span></span><span style=" font-size: small;"></span><span style=" font-family: Sylfaen;"><span style=" font-size: small;">butter and butter with jam.<br />
After you are done created a list, go through all of your links to see that one easily </span></span><span style=" font-size: small;"></span><span style=" font-family: Sylfaen;"><span style=" font-size: small;">follows into the next. If you can’t find the next link after viewing one, you probably didn’t associate a vivid enough picture to the resulting details.</span></span><span style=" font-size: small;"></span></p>
